### GENERAL

Hello Voltage Park Team, thank you for giving me the opportunity to work on this takehome! It was pretty fun.

### SETUP

1. Setup & run backend environment + install modules:
    a. Open new terminal.
    b. Create a virtual environment via running CLI 'python -m venv .venv' in terminal
    c. Run 'source .venv/bin/activate' (mac) or '.\.venv\Scripts\activate' (windows)
    d. Navigate to 'backend' subdirectory and run 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
    e. Run 'python manage.py runserver' to spin up backend API server.

2. Setup & run frontend environment + install modules:
    a. Navigate to 'frontend' subdirectory
    b. Run 'npm install' to install all modules.
    c. Run 'npm run dev' to spin up frontend development server.

3. Tests have been included for the three critical backend endpoints. Use CLI command 'python manage.py test' to initiate testing sequence.
